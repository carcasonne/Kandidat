TODO

- Better separation of runs and metrics
    * DataClass seems like the way to go
- Different kind of visualizations
    * now only for graphs
    * also need to fetch the confusion matrix and calculate precision/recall class-wise. Currently only calculated for the "true" class.
    * make pretty confusion matrix for report
- Get dataset property metrics fetched and stored to prevent multiple loads of dataset
- Refine dataset propety metrics visualization, looks like shit rn
